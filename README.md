## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

With this project I had the change to chalange my skills with front-end, I usually work with back-end and this work made me practice the abilities for building interfaces.

It's a eye-opening work to build mobile-first applications, as this one, very nice to work with responsiveness in CSS that stays clean and easy to understand.
