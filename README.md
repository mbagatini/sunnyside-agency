### What I learned

With this project I had the change to chalange my skills with front-end, I usually work with back-end and this work made me practice the abilities for building interfaces.

It's a eye-opening work to build mobile-first applications, as this one, very nice to work with responsiveness in CSS that stays clean and easy to understand.
